    <h2>PROCEDURE : </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make fresh chhena by curdling milk with lemon juice or vinegar. Once curdled, drain the whey and keep the chhena aside.Knead the chhena for 5-7 minutes until smooth and free of lumps.Shape the chhena into small, flat, round discs (about 1 inch in diameter).</li>
        <li>In a large pan, bring 2 cups of water and 1 cup of sugar to a boil.Gently drop the shaped chhena dumplings into the boiling syrup.Let them cook for about 10-12 minutes. The dumplings should puff up and absorb the syrup.Once done, remove the dumplings from the syrup and set them aside to cool.</li>
        <li>In another pan, bring the milk (1 liter) to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer.Let the milk reduce to about half its original volume while stirring occasionally.Add sugar (1 cup) and cardamom powder to the boiling milk, and stir until dissolved.Add the soaked saffron to the milk mixture and continue to simmer until it thickens slightly. You should have a creamy, flavorful milk sauce.Optionally, add a few drops of rose water or kewra essence for added fragrance.</li>
        <li>Gently place the sugar-soaked chhena dumplings into the prepared rabri (milk sauce).Let the dumplings soak in the milk for about 2-3 hours or until they absorb the flavors and become soft.</li>
        <li>Garnish with slivered almonds and pistachios.
            Serve the Rasmalai chilled or at room temperature for a refreshing treat!</li>
