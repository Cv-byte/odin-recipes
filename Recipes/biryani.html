    <h2>DESCRIPTION :</h2>
    <p>Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic rice dish that originated in the Indian subcontinent and is loved worldwide. It is made by layering fragrant basmati rice with spiced meat (chicken, mutton, or fish) or vegetables, often cooked with rich spices like saffron, cardamom, and cloves. The dish is slow-cooked to perfection, allowing the flavors to meld beautifully. Garnished with fried onions, fresh herbs, and sometimes nuts or raisins, biryani is a symbol of indulgence and is often served with raita (yogurt sauce) or salan (spicy curry).</p>
